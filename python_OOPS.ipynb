        "Q1.What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses \"objects\" to represent data and methods to manipulate that data. OOP is based on several key concepts, including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. It allows for the creation of modular, reusable code and helps in organizing complex programs by modeling real-world entities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- A class in OOP is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the created objects will have. Classes encapsulate data for the object and provide a way to define behaviors associated with that data. For example, a Car class might have attributes like color and model, and methods like drive() and stop().\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete representation of the class that contains actual values for the attributes defined in the class. Objects can interact with one another and can be manipulated using the methods defined in their class. For example, if Car is a class, then my_car could be an object of that class with specific values for color and model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts. It allows a programmer to focus on interactions at a higher level without needing to understand the intricate details. For example, when using a car, you know how to drive it without needing to understand how the engine works.\n",
        "- Encapsulation, on the other hand, is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which is a means of preventing unintended interference and misuse of the methods and data. This is often achieved through access modifiers (like private, protected, and public).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Dunder methods, short for \"double underscore\" methods, are special methods in Python that have double underscores at the beginning and end of their names (e.g., __init__, __str__, __repr__). These methods allow you to define the behavior of your objects for built-in operations. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. __init__: Initializes a new object.\n",
        "2. __str__: Defines a string representation of the object, used by the print() function.\n",
        "3. __repr__: Defines a more formal string representation of the object, often used for debugging.\n",
        "4. __add__: Allows the use of the + operator to add two objects together.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dunder methods enable you to customize the behavior of your objects in a way that integrates seamlessly with Python's syntax and built-in functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        "- Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP that allows a new class (called a subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (called a superclass or base class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if you have a base class Animal with methods like eat() and sleep(), you can create a subclass Dog that inherits these methods and can also have its own methods like bark(). This way, Dog can use the functionality of Animal without rewriting the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism is another core concept in OOP that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types).\n",
        "\n",
        "In practical terms, polymorphism allows methods to be defined in a base class and overridden in derived classes. For example, if both Dog and Cat classes inherit from an Animal class and implement a method make_sound(), you can call make_sound() on an Animal reference that could point to either a Dog or a Cat, and the appropriate method will be executed based on the actual object type.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, encapsulation is achieved through the use of access modifiers:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Public: Attributes and methods are accessible from outside the class.\n",
        "- Protected: Attributes and methods are prefixed with a single underscore (e.g., _attribute), indicating they should not be accessed directly outside the class or its subclasses.\n",
        "- Private: Attributes and methods are prefixed with double underscores (e.g., __attribute), making them inaccessible from outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "- A constructor in Python is a special method called __init__() that is automatically invoked when an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize the object's attributes and set up any necessary state.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10.What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, class methods and static methods are two types of methods that can be defined within a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Class Method: A class method is defined using the @classmethod decorator and takes cls as its first parameter, which refers to the class itself. Class methods can access and modify class state that applies across all instances of the class.\n",
        "- Static Method: A static method is defined using the @staticmethod decorator and does not take self or cls as its first parameter. It behaves like a regular function but belongs to the class's namespace. Static methods cannot access or modify class or instance state.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "- Method overloading refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (i.e., different types or numbers of arguments) within the same class. However, Python does not support method overloading in the traditional sense as seen in languages like Java or C++. Instead, you can achieve similar functionality by using default arguments or variable-length arguments (using *args and **kwargs).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method in the subclass has the same name, return type, and parameters as the method in the superclass. This allows the subclass to provide a specific behavior while still maintaining the interface of the superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- The @property decorator in Python is used to define a method as a property, allowing you to access it like an attribute. This is useful for encapsulating private attributes and providing getter and setter methods in a more Pythonic way. It allows you to control access to an attribute and add logic when getting or setting its value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism is important in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types). Polymorphism promotes flexibility and reusability in code, allowing for easier maintenance and the ability to extend functionality without modifying existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to be subclassed. It can contain abstract methods (methods that are declared but contain no implementation) that must be implemented by any concrete subclass. Abstract classes are defined using the abc module, which provides the ABC class and the @abstractmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Encapsulation: OOP allows bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. This helps in hiding the internal state of the object and only exposing a controlled interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Inheritance: OOP supports inheritance, which allows a new class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass). This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism: OOP allows methods to be defined in different classes with the same name but different implementations. This enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Abstraction: OOP enables the creation of abstract classes and interfaces, allowing developers to define methods that must be created within any child classes, while hiding complex implementation details.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Modularity: OOP promotes modularity, making it easier to manage and maintain code. Each class can be developed, tested, and debugged independently.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature that allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class. This means that a derived class can access attributes and methods from multiple base classes. While this can be powerful and promote code reuse, it can also lead to complexity, especially in cases where the same method is defined in multiple parent classes (the \"diamond problem\"). Python uses the Method Resolution Order (MRO) to determine the order in which base classes are searched when executing a method.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- Code Reusability: It allows the child class to reuse methods from the parent class without explicitly naming the parent class, making the code more maintainable and flexible.\n",
